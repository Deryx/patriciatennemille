                    <p>I am qualified to become the next Rockland County Family Court Judge because of my experiences and my passion relating to the area of Family Law. I am fair, honest, enthusiastic, and committed. I have great empathy and understand that, as a judge, I impact lives and, thereby, impact the community.</p>

                    <p>As a Family Court Judge, I would be in a unique position to ensure that families are supported and assisted. A strong family creates a strong community and, in turn, a strong community creates a strong society. I would be honored if you would allow me the privilege of serving the residents of Rockland County as Family Court Judge.</p>

                    <p>Finally,</p>
